                        the Tarot.
                        <br /> In this course I've learnt a lot more than I could imagine about this universe. I've searched
                        in books but nothing compares to the oral transmission.
                        <br /> Paulina is a knowledgeable investigator who is attentive and present in every moment.
                        <br /> Highly recommended! Each class is a profound and transformative journey.

                        <br /> That's when she showed up with this delightful course, gently teaching us with an objective
                        and funny language, making it easy to understand.
                        <br /> This course is sensational and I will carry it forever throughout my life. Do I even have to

Having such a humble teacher, and at the same time so wise of the occult knowledge, has made this joureney VERY MEANINGFUL AND SPECIAL. <br>THE UNIVERSE OF THE TAROT is an invitation for us to SHARPEN OUR INTUITION and comprehend a world of symbols that is so ancient and so fundamental to our existence in this world. Sharing this learning journey with such incredible women, who hold different stories, potentializes the richness of this course. <br>I give thanks to Paulina for the tenderness, dedication and honesty with which she conducts her work, thanks for welcoming us in your path.
