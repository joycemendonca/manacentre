    <p>
      This site uses cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
      What are cookies? As is common practice at almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are small files downloaded onto your computer to improve your user experience. This page describes what information they collect, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies being stored: however, this may downgrade or “break” certain elements of the sites functionality. <br><br>
  
      How do we use cookies? We use cookies for a number of reasons, detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options to disable cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave all cookies if you are unsure whether or not you need them if they are used to provide a service that you use.
      Disable cookies <br><br>
  
      You can prevent cookies being set by adjusting your browser settings (see browser Help to find out how to do this). Please be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites you visit. We therefore recommend that you do not disable cookies. <br><br>
  
      Cookies relating to email newsletters <br><br>
  
      This site offers a Newsletter, sent by email. Cookies can be used to remember whether you are already registered and whether to show certain notifications valid only for registered / unsubscribed users. <br><br>
  
      Order processing related cookies <br><br>
  
      This site offers e-commerce or payment facilities and some cookies are essential to ensure that your order is remembered between pages so that we can process it properly. 
      Survey-related cookies <br><br>
  
      We periodically offer surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting information, useful tools or to understand our user base more accurately. These surveys may use cookies to remember who has already participated in a survey or to provide accurate results after changing pages. <br><br>
  
      Form-related cookies <br><br>
  
      When you submit data via a form such as those found on contact pages or comment forms, cookies may be set to remember user details for future correspondence. <br><br>
  
      Website preference cookies <br><br>
  
      To provide you with an optimal experience on this site, we provide functionality to set your preferences for how this site runs when you use it. To remember your preferences, we need to set cookies so that this information can be called up whenever you interact with a page that is affected by your preferences. <br><br>
  
      Third Party Cookies <br><br>
  
      In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details which third-party cookies you may encounter through this site. <br><br>
  
      This site uses Google Analytics, which is one of the web’s most widespread and trusted analytics solutions, to help us understand how you use the site and how we can improve your experience. These cookies can track things like how long you spend on the site and the pages you visit so that we can continue to produce engaging content. For more information about Google Analytics cookies, please see the official Google Analytics page. Third party analytics are used to track and measure the use of this website so that we can continue to produce compelling content. These cookies may track things like the time you spend on the site or the pages you visit, which helps us understand how we can improve the site for you. <br><br>
  
      Periodically, we test new features and make subtle changes to the way the site looks. When we are still testing new features, these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience while on the site, while we understand which optimizations our users appreciate the most. As we sell services, it’s important that we understand statistics on how many visitors to our site actually buy and so that’s the kind of data these cookies will track. This is important to you as it means we can make accurate business forecasts that allow us to analyze advertising and service costs, so we can secure the best possible price. <br><br>
  
      The Mana Centre for Awareness Development is open to any clarifications on the cookie policy and as mentioned earlier, if there is something you are not sure whether you need or not, it is generally safer to leave cookies enabled to interact with all the features our site offers. <br><br>
