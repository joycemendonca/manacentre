      <h2>
        Trust your intuition and<br />
        unleash your potency.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Most of us are born with intuitive skills but nobody teaches us how to own them. In fact, as we learn to grow submissive, docile and fearful, we are taught by a patriachal system to repress our innate powers.
        <br /><br />
        If you are looking to connect to your intuition with confidence even though you know nothing about spirituality... ✅<br />
        if you're seeking to improve the quality of your relationships without losing yourself in the  process... ✅<br />
        if you want to manifest your growth without depending on fake gurus or partners... ✅<br />
      </p>

      <h3>
        YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
      </h3>

      <p>
        My Tarot reading has a therapeutic approach with sparkles of divination. That means, I honour you as the protagonist of your life, with agency on your destiny and I refuse to place you as a mere object of it. Tarot has no power to change your life if you don't take the steps to make the necessary adjustments. But it has the power to show us the ways to a prosper life!
        <br /><br />
        This course is designed to give you solid basis for you to build your Tarot practice on.<br />
        I'll give you all you need to read for youself and for others.
        <br /><br />
        <i>Experience with Tarot is welcome, but not required!</i>
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Hi, I am Paulina!</h2>

      <p class="text-center box-center" style="max-width: 730px;">
        I am a professional Tarot reader for 10 years and in the last 3 years I have taught 5 classes of THE UNIVERSE OF THE TAROT. I am a practitioner of contemporary alternative therapies, a trained medium in the field of Apometry and priestess of traditional practices.
        <br /><br />
        My work is entirely devoted to increasing women's awareness of their personal potency and enabling healing by promoting their connection to the divine.
        <br /><br />
        My mission is to hold space and capacitate women to ground in their self-empowerment and hone in their sense of self-direction, firmly secure by a spiritual backing and truth.
