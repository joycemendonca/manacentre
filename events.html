                     <p>
                        The WHEEL OF THE YEAR is no beginning and never ending cycle. It follows the cycles of nature throughout its seasons, as well as the relationship between these cycles and the human being, that is, the harvests. The calendar of the harvests is based on the calendar of the seasons, and it’s been like this since before we could have registered and can remember. In northern Europe, where the societies are marked by a harsh winter, this harvest calendar called WHEEL OF THE YEAR has been especially relevant, as the survival of our species depends on it in this part of the world. It is a huge ancient tradition in Europe to follow this calendar. A tradition that has only been relatively recently broken by the industrial revolution. Still, every human being depends on the seasons and of nature to survive - this is where our food comes from!
                     </p>                   

                   <p>
                        Although we are not taking care of an actual harvest, the changes in the seasons change us inside in all levels: physical, mental and emotional. When we connect to these movements of nature, we connect to our bodies and we to our awareness. Here at MANA Centre, we celebrate these dates in beautiful ceremonies!
    
                   </p> 
                   <p>
                        Each celebration has a name, its own qualities, its own materials and its rituals - all based on what is happening in nature at the same time. At YULE, the Earth is born. At CANDLEMAS, She is a girl full of hopes. At OSTARA, a young virgin, full of life. An adolescent discovering Her sexuality at BELTANE. The mother at LITHA, the matron at LAMMAS. She enters menopause at MABON and She is the elder at SAMHAIN, when She dies to reborn again at YULE.
                   </p>  

                   <p>
                        Note that all of these festivals celebrate the relationship between the Earth and the Sun, which is symbolic to our own interior union!. The light of the Sun on the surface of the Earth. The Light of the Truth inside of our hearts. The processes of birth, growth, death and rebirth is portrayed in the WHEEL OF THE YEAR, that symbolizes the movements of continuous transformation and evolution of our planet and, therefore, of ourselves. The WHEEL is always in balance, because when in one hemisphere there is harvest and death, in the other there is planting and sprouting. When you consciously experience the changes of the cycles of the Earth, you learn about the changes and transformations of yourself. You know the cycle of the year and you know that the same is present in your body, mind, heart and soul. You know that this transformation is Law and you start using this law in favour of your own dreams.

                <p>
                    The 21 days before Kings Day (06 Jan) are imbued with a great level of high vibration energy. So, every year on the 16th of December at around noon, an Abundance Portal opens! This rainbow-shaped portal unites, end to end, the eminence of the New Year with the dream of Paradise. The legend says that during these 21 days, the Three Wise Men followed the Guiding Star to find the Divine Child, a symbol of renovation of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time, it is possible to take some abundance initiative and accomplish the daily Abundance Portal ritual. In the Abundance Portal Ritual we will make the main candle that accompany us for the entirety of the coming year. Along with this candle, we will consecrate 13 wishes, one for each moon of the following year. Anyone can do this, regardless of their beliefs.
                </p>
